            <strong>alicia no</strong> (b. 1990) paints and lives in brooklyn, new york.
            A lifelong resident of the mid-atlantic, usa, she grew up in a mixed family in the d.c. suburbs, studied architecture in philly, and currently works in the software industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Always a maker as a mode of traversing through life, alicia returned to painting in 2016 after becoming interested in the meditative, devotional significance of slow image-making, in an era where images are so cheap-to-make and easy-to-binge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work here explores many themes, including the nature of boundaries, identity politics, private realities, culture as a by-product of technology, and the intimacy that exists between people and landscapes.
          </p>
          <p>
            alicia also likes books, folk music and going outside. Say hello at <a href="mailto:aliciayesorno@gmail.com">aliciayesorno@gmail.com</a>.
